# Code Contribution (to application):

# Program Purpose: "why/purpose of the code" The program is designed to read daily flow rates
# from a CSV file and calculate the monthly and yearly flow rates totals at a specific monitoring station, 
# St. Lawrence River at Cornwall

# Assumptions: User wants daily flow rates from the St. Lawrence River at Cornwall

# Program Structure:

# Assumptions (affecting Program Structure): None

# Limitations (Plans): Data is limited to the years 1958-1993 and only from the specific river,
# St. Lawernece River at specific monitoring station, St. Lawrence River at Cornwall

# Special Cases and Known Problems: 1958 cannot be run in the program due to no data being provided
# for the entire months of Jan-Jun. This would cause a zero division error during the  ???

# User Inputs: Year from user, Daily Discharge (m3/s) from CSV file
# Outputs: Average Monthly Discharge (m3/s), and Total Yearly Discharge (m3/s) from CSV file
